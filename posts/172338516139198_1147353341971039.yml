      this might not be very relevant, but I once succeeded it running making an ASP.NET application run a java program on GoDaddy's shared hosting, I put a portable version of JRE over there and executed it and it worked!
      ... kind of, the JAR file was a Minecraft Server, it ran and I saw the console output (I redirected it), but their firewall prevented me from connecting to that server :D
