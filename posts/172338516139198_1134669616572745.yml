  Whenever I open a torrent using Vodafone USB modem, the whole connection is cut off (torrent itself and browsing).

  I take the modem in and out several times until it works (even the torrent).

  This happened too often to call it a coincidence.
  Why can an ISP choose what I want to do with my connection? :D

      According to Fady, it might well be a coincidence. Maybe it's just too unstable.

      It might also be something technicians related, not policy / ban related, that is caused in some how to the instability.

      The fact that torrent works when you connect again is the most interesting piece.

    message: It's unreliable to torrent over 3G connection anyways as you couldn't
      get full download speed for direct download meanwhile you need extra third party
      app to get full speed over 3G , and for torrents it requires high bandwidth
      , also maybe your ISP throttling torrent ports while speed in usb modem slow
      so it may appear disconnected

      Its extremely weird.
      The funny thing, when the connection is back I get the full 700 KB/s

      Does anyone know how is the metadata phase different from the download phase?
      It seems when I start the torrent (after several trials) I have no issues during the download itself.
