  Hi guys,

  I've an issue with Docker in MacOS 10.11.4. Whenever i mount a volume to docker container it's only mounting the folder and not including the files or sub folders. I've searched a lot of forums but no hope. Only a github issue is talking about an issue with the boot2load iso image and i've changed it with no hope too.

    message: It's all about the folder i'm using. It was a shared folder and docker
      only can share the folders under your user directory. So the project folder
      should be in the following path "/Users/....."
