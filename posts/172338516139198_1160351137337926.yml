  Haven't posted here in a while, I noticed people were talking about browsers, and I felt that I wanted to share with you what I think is the best kept browser secret, Opera Browser. Of course you all know the name and some of you have tried it, but I do urge the ones who haven't to download it and try the adblocker, not a single add in youtube, actually only one inline showed up, unlike chrome which shows me the same ad every time I refresh, not a single pop up and a much cleaner, snappier browsing experience.

  Please share your thoughts.

      is that what you were taught on how to behave/? Please refrain from making low

      rude people are not really apealling or respectable to me

      It's a hard situation to easily pick a side, it used to be easy to say ads are good for business until it got abused and not talking about privacy only, but even malware now get served through ads, not mentioning the horrible experience of noisy and rude ads.
      I personally pay for YouTube Red to get rid of ads and still pay the content producers I admire and want to support, but I also use uBlock Origin for the general web mainly due to protect against malware.

      I will shamelessly share an article I wrote about opera 3 years ago
      https://alfy.me/2013/08/16/give-opera-some-time.html
      Well be back with more. Opera is more than a browser with ad blocking built in

    message: I would like to chime in here and add that even the Facebook browsing
      experience is different, not having ads in my face is amazing, it becomes my
      social networking account again. I believe all these ads in the background work
      on your mind sending subliminal messages, and your mind just gets cluttered
      with all these unnecessary thoughts. Maybe this could be the reason for so many
      people getting ADHD or symptoms like that. On thing is for sure, I move from
      Windows to an OS like Debian with iceweasal once because I just wanted to get
      a pure experience again, an OS that was mine, no one had the right to invade
      my space with messages I wasn't asking for. P.S. Debian and all FOSS are exactly
      that, Free and Open Source, I am sure others have experience using TOR, this
      is similar, but does not using a diffrent netwroking protocol, and your still
