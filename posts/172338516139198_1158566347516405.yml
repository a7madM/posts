  Hello Geeks, in our company we do provide domain and hosting services for our clients, so we need a tool to monitor the domain name/hosting expiration and send us alerts or notifications for a specific period we choose. Example 1 month before expiration.

  Notes: 1- We know that the registerer send notifications, but we need to add multi registerer and we need to set the notification time.

  2- We did a search on Google and found some like DomainTools.com but it did not monitor the hosting (if we used a shared hosting).

  3- One of my friends suggested to use Google Calendar, but that is a manual thing, we aim to get an automated service

  4- If we found that this service is not exist, then what about building one?

  Thanks for your contribution.

    message: I didn't get your point , you mean for example you re-sell a shared hosting
      from hostgator to client A , and another one to Client B , you need a tool to
      keep tracking of those hosting expiration date to remind you to renew ?!!!
