  Gees, I have a wordpress question.
  I have two plugins, and I want to take a field that the first plugin inputs, and echo it onto the other plugin.

  Is it even possible :D ?

      Okay let me explain.

      First Plugin, gives out a field called = billing_field_887
      This field is a custom text field for woocommerce.

      The second plugin is a ticketing plugin, using the below style in echoing data.
                          <?php echo $WooCommerceEventsHourEnd.':'.$WooCommerceEventsMinutesEnd; ?>

      Now, I want to echo the billing_field_887 from the first plugin to this page.
