    message: "in Android activities can not interact with each other using interfaces
      \ not like (activity/fragment) interaction so there has to be a solution for
      that which is the Pub/Sub design pattern in other word EventBus \n\nit is like
      Action<> in C# if you worked with it before, in simple terms EventBus used to
      send a msg(Publisher) and if there are any activity/fragment is listening to
      that msg(Subscriber), it is like using Broadcasts but without the need for it.\n\nusing
      it you can send a whole class not just a msg for instance you can send a UserProfileInfos
      \n\nNote: EventBus delivers it's msgs by value not by reference"
