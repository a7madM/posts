  Anybody experienced issues with communication with Web Service using USB / Mobile Internet provided by Mobinil ?

  What I mean is like getting unwanted data like ads or something in the response ? Does Mobinil ( Orange ) does that ?

  I have many devices communicating with Severs using Orange internet ( USB / Mobile Internet ), and sometimes they doesn't get the expected response at all, doing a debug code now to track that, but just wanted to ask if someone face issues like that ..

  Sure I have all errors turned off on the server side, as I have them logged in files.

      I don't know if there are any other ads as I use ad blocker
