message: 'Good morning everyone, I was looking for an app creating platform which
  I''ll use to make an online store so it has to have the feature of e-payment. Some
  of the good platforms I have looked at include: IBuildApps, AppMachine, and BiznessApps.
  These options are great options but have a flaw of integrating Paypal or other payment
  gateways that are not supported in Egypt. I know that you can use Paypal in Egypt
  but if I do I am forced to use non-EGP currencies which are supported by Paypal
  which is not something I can accept. If anyone has a better solution for me or any
  idea, please do not hesitate to suggest. Thank you.'

    message: "Honestly I don't think you'll be able to process payments on the scale
      you're aiming for, free tools and such. You'll either need to work with a payment
      gateway or a bank inside Egypt that processes payments (most I've seen used
      is AAIB), but it's a security and paperwork hassle etc. I don't imagine you
      have an official company registered etc, do you? \n\nTwo options though, you
      can either do cash on delivery and use a third party like, I don't know, Aramex
      or something (and they cannibalize part of your profit, of course) if you're
      selling physical goods or if you're selling digital items (music, a big sword
      in a game etc.) then you can use Google and Apple, like In-App Purchase on iOS.
      But they take a massive cut (30% last time I checked). If you're selling digital
      stuff that's the only option anyway, otherwise you're rejected."
