      It would be better to use a virtual machine for ASP.NET ( in case you are a linux user ).
      Running Microsoft applications is not a good idea.
      It wont give you the same performance.

      Why not make an issue on the ASP.NET 5 repo on github?
      Or maybe ask on their jabbr channel :)

      Ok so this was the issue

      "EntityFramework.SQLite": "7.0.0-rc1-final", "EntityFramework.SQLite.Design": "7.0.0-rc1-final",
      Instead of
      "EntityFramework.Sqlite": "7.0.0-rc1-final",
      "EntityFramework.Sqlite.Design": "7.0.0-rc1-final",
      Notice that first 2 lines were what the intellisense completed ...
