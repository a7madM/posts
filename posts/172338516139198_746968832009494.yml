  I'm thinking of using my blog for all my posts online (like a tumblr). I'm searching for a theme with these features

  1. Clean UI
  2. Good support for Arabic (or easy to do myself)
  3. Beautiful !!!
  4. As tumblr, some posts will have no title, just a post date & some text

  Any suggestions?

    message: "1. My goal: Something like tumblr: good for small posts as well as long-form
      writing. I want to host it myself because I had an old blog hosted on SpellCoder
      which doesn't exist anymore!\n\n2. Currently I'm using Pelican for my blog.
      Pelican is a static site builder, like Jekyll.\n\n3. I'm searching for a good
      theme which fits my above requirements, but I can look into another platforms
      if it fits me better.\n\n4. Medium allows Arabic, but the layout is always LTR.
      \n\n5. Svbtle is invitation-only & I can't host it"
