message: Should I buy IntelliJ IDEA instead of WebStorm and RubyMine? Does it include
  both (as plugins)? Does it get the same updates when they get it?

    message: Thanks. From link 2 it seemed the updates arrive very very late to IntelliJ,
      which made me hesitant on it. I tweeted it a few minutes before asking this
      question but haven't got comments yet. I guess my main question is how practically
      they keep the plugins and actual IDEs in sync.

    message: I'm also not sure what they mean by simpler settings and opening from
      folder not being supported. I wonder whether it's possible but is an edge case
      to use IntelliJ for these, or is common and not exactly adventurous.

    message: So, it is confirmed that RubyMine is fully inclusive of WebStorm, and
      IntelliJ IDEA has most RubyMine features (except ones shared with AppCode, and
      except simplified project/folder options, and maybe other things).

    message: The question remains, *in practice* is it a good idea to just get IDEA?
      Anyone here made the decision to buy both IDEA and RubyMine (or to not do so)?
      How did that go?
