    message: Try to use samples and build off of that, what will waste your time the
      most is getting over the configuration, so Spring.xml and maven, that is why
      I recommend using a simple project with a sample already configured and add
      to that.

    message: Just make sure you understand what everything does and the concept of
      the front controller for MVC. Also that MVC is only a part of Spring, look at
      how it does dependency injection and how the FW gets started. Start slow and
      learn the details because it does have a lot of them.
