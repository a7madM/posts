  are google ads something that I should fear ??!!
  I recently got to know Neo4j  graph database .. and suddenly I can see many ads about it in many websites that I visit !!!!
  do you see these ads yourselves?!! or does it really  relate with my browsing experience ???

      Yes Google is doing that all the time :)
      They see what you've searched about and they deliver ads that matches your interests.. And in all cases I stopped trusting Google for a while now

      Actually Microsoft did a huge ads campaign to raise awareness for users and to get some benefits itself it's called the Scroogled ads
      Check this one:

      You can try duckduckgo.com, I think that was the name, it respects your privacy.
      Also, use Firefox as your default browser.
      And don't use android.
      I have encountered the same thing when I started learning Ruby on Rails, tons of ads either offering jobs as a developer or offering education resources. So yeah, google is more snoopy than a paranoid girlfriend.

    message: That's how you pay for the great search service. Nothing is really free

    message: frankly I didn't know that they are taking that much of data .. i think
      its a problem if google knew what is my topics and search affinity .. at least
      they should reveal their compiled data about me and my behaviour and/or give
      me the chance to delete my footage from their servers. [[ who knows what are
      they keeping and what not ]] .. now I am thinking of hacking their coockies
      to send false information about me .. so that I F* their analysis algorithms
      :(
