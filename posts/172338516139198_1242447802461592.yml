      Does your input have an id "input" ?
      try $('input').val()

      depending on the type of input...
      your example is right for a textfield but for a dropdown you do $('#dropDownId :selected').text();
      for a checkbox or a radio button it's a complete different story

      You're talking about Partial Views that you call with Html.RenderPartial right?
      When you render a partial view, basically all of it's contents gets copied to the parent view, so the output to the browser is one single rendered html, there are no iframes or any kind of magic, so javascript doesn't know that you have a partial view, it only knows about the single combined output. So to get the value of the input inside a partial view is the same as getting the value of the input in the parent view, same code.
      If you're having problems getting it by ID $("#input-id") then you might have more than one element with the same ID and you should always avoid that.

    message: perhaps what is needed is to enclose the code in  $(document).ready()
      , because maybe the partial view wasn't rendered before the textbox was rendered

    message: and sometimes even $(document).ready()  doesn't work and you can create
      a script tag at the bottom of the page to test that theory
