      You get a host (prices can vary depending on what you're deploying) then upload your html and css files through an FTP (file transfer protocol) to the server.
      Deployment can be done on any device, there are numerous apps for iPad, iPhone, Mac, linux and even windows to help you start an FTP connection and thus deploy

    message: Amr, yes, you scared me. If we spend time on this page explaining that
      you need a host to publish a website or what FTP stands for, then the page is
      not really a geeks page and is completely screwed.
